# TÃœDU (v1.0.0)

A simple webapp for project management

![App Preview](/assets/TUDU2.png)

---
**Why?**
- To build a crazy simple webapp for project and task tracking
- To learn more about web development

--- 
Currently, tasks and projects are saved on a per-machine basis. This means
that when you close your browser and reopen the app, your projects should
be there waiting for you.

The drawback of this approach is that loading your project list on different
machines is currently not supported.
